		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely going to have to try this when I get home tonight thank you very much for the information. I&#039;m running Linux Mint, the commands would likely be the same I&#039;m assuming? Thanks again.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks!!, I got it to work as well with your explanations.
I had to add the two lines to /etc/network/interfaces like you say, but did not need the &quot;sudo reload smbd&quot; command.
Instead I believe this is just given as an example in the message output, referring to the the Samba network file system daemon (which has nothing to do with network connections). The message is just proposing a &quot;better way&quot;, your &quot;sudo ifup usb0&quot; got executed anyway.
In my case however I did not need ifup, but this command: &quot;sudo restart network-manager&quot;. Since I use the Ubuntu NetworkManager, which is the default setting.
Executing ifup should not be needed anyway, as this should be called by the ifplugd daemon when a cable is plugged in (at least this was the case for wired Ethernet in ubuntu 11.04 or so).]]></description>
