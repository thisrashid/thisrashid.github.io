		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rashid, I tried a few other plugins before I got to yours and it&#039;s great to find it working in version 3.5.1 of WordPress! I have a question, on the WP version of the blog the plugin works fine http://www.awarenessclinic.co.uk/news/ but this blog is integrated into an existing website, see http://www.awarenessclinic.co.uk/news.php. The FB link shows fine, but the Twitter and G+ are not displaying properly. I have a feeling that I need to edit the path to the image in de editor, could you help me in the right direction so Twitter and G+ will display properly also on my website? Ta!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Thanks for using my plugin.

I have made necessary changes in the plugin to meet your requirement, but due to some problem with wordpress I am not able to upload my updated plugin to their server. Once I upload the plugin you just need to update it. Then you will get an option to select the position of the buttons.

I hope it will help you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The plugin seems to work OK in WordPress. It shows how many people &quot;like&quot; the post, but nothing seems to happen in Facebook itself. I post a link to the blogpost in Facebook, and people who like it in Facebook show up there, but the count in Facebook doesn&#039;t reflect the count in the plugin. Is there no actual connection between the plugin and Facebook? When people &quot;like&quot; the post on my blog, does their &quot;like&quot; show up anywhere else?

Thanks,
Norm]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rashid, I like your plugin, but I&#039;ve got two issues: if I click on &quot;Tweet&quot; on my blogroll, Twitter wants to tweet my webpage, in stead of the particular post under which the icon is displayed. When I click on the title of a post (post = cartoon in my case), to open it, and then click on the tweet icon, twitter wants to tweet the post - which is what I would like to do.

Further: amount of likes in Facebook appears to be higher than mentioned under my posts.

Best Regards,
Ronald]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rashid,

Your Socialize plug-in was working before, but no longer does. I tried updating Suffusion (theme), but that didn&#039;t solve the problem. I am using the latest Wordpress version. Any ideas?

TIA,
Liz]]></description>
