		<description><![CDATA[Rashid, why is it that after I installed ra-socialize, everytime I copy paste link of my posting, network.stamperz.com always appears? Very annoying. I already deleted the plugin, but still the copy paste result the same. I cleared cache, didn&#039;t work. My hosting company said, that network.stamperz.com appearance came from your plugin. When I deleted it, the people from my hosting company could see normal appearance of the copy pasted link, but I still have that network.stamperz.com appearance until now! I can&#039;t get rid of it from my computer. I ain&#039;t no computer literate so this might be a piece of cake for you but for me it&#039;s a big deal. Please help... thank you]]></description>
